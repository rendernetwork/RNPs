## Overview

The purpose of the Render Network Foundation is **maintaining the core Render Network protocol and growing its community**.

In **RNP-001**, the Render Network community voted to enact the **Burn Mint Equilibrium (BME)** model, a network economic mechanism. This includes:

- Representing the Render Network in commercial contracts on behalf of the community  
- Overseeing grants designed to promote use of the Network  
- Overseeing the distribution of node rewards  
- Maintaining the operations of the Foundation  

In that proposal, **annual allocations are required**.  
This document sets forth **Year 3 of BME Emissions Allocations**.

---

## Reasoning

It is worth reviewing the accomplishments across the Render Network in the **second year under the BME model** — passed in RNP-001 and revised in RNP-006.

Year-to-date in **2025**, the Render Network community saw:

- The first customer conference, **RenderCon**, launched and hosted  
- Network usage (denominated in euros) **+87% vs. 2024 YTD through October**  
  - Note: this gap is anticipated to reduce by year-end, given the significant proportion of work done at the end of Q4 2024  
- Supported the launch of a **new VFX workflow**, making the Render Network highly attractive for VFX studios  
- **377 artist grants** (since inception)  
- Tokens upgraded from Ethereum (**RNDR**) to Solana (**RENDER**) reached **77%**, with **423M RENDER** upgraded (through October)  
- Test launch of a dedicated **compute subnet** under **RNP-019** to capture AI growth in computing needs and the shift in compute for graphics rendering  
- Expanded and refined systems for the Network and Foundation operations  
- Passed **RNP-021: Expansion of RNP-019 to Include Enterprise-Grade Compute**

Several of these developments are discussed in more detail below.
