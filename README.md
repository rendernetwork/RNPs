# Render Network Proposals (RNPs)

![](banner.png)
**Please read through RNP-000 before constructing your first RNP.** RNPs should be well thought out and discussed across the appropriate Render Network Community channels.

## Guidelines for RNPs

 1. Members should research previous proposals to ensure that their RNP has not already been submitted or does not conflict with a proposal up for vote.
 2. RNPs that conflict with a proposal that is currently up for vote, will only be put up for vote after a significant time has elapsed from when the first proposal was voted on in order to avoid conflicts and wasted effort.
 3. RNPs will be removed from consideration if they involve illegal activity, hate speech, pornographic material, or do not represent the mission or values of the Render Network.
 4. Technically infeasible RNPs will be removed from consideration during the review period - i.e. a component of the review process is assessing whether RNPs are actionable.

## Community Principles
* *Equality*: It is important that everyone feels like they have a voice no matter their background and however small or large they are. The network is working to bring high end 3D graphics and related digital experiences to anyone with a creative vision.
* *Constructiveness*: The network is more than the sum of its parts, and looks for positive contributions to building the future of decentralized GPU computing.
* *Transparency*: Decisions will be publicly communicated openly and communication channels will provide open, publicly accessible forums to debate the future of RNPs.

***All RNP statuses can be viewed within Github, where they are classified as "Draft Submission", "In Render Team Review", "Open for RNP Vote", "Rejected", "Approved and on the Roadmap", “In Development” and “Implemented”.***
