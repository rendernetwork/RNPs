## Overview
This RNP proposes the creation of a public API endpoint that allows for the programmatic creation and payment of Render Network jobs using a crypto wallet containing Render Tokens (RNDR/Render). This will enable agentic systems, such as AI agents and blockchain-based autonomous organizations (DAOs), to seamlessly interact with the Render Network without requiring human intervention for scene uploads, job submissions, and payments. To ensure a smooth user experience, a 1:1 redemption rate between Render Credits and Render Tokens for render time on the network is also proposed.

## Reasoning
This RNP proposes a significant enhancement to the Render Network by enabling programmatic access for agentic systems. This aligns with the Render Network's goal of decentralization and community-driven development. By enabling programmatic access to the network, this RNP opens up new possibilities for integrating rendering capabilities into a wider range of applications and workflows, potentially driving further adoption and growth of the Render Network.

### Agentic System Integration
Currently, interacting with the Render Network requires manual navigation of the OTOY website and manual actions for scene uploads, job submissions, and payments. This presents a barrier for agentic systems that need to programmatically access and utilize the network's rendering capabilities.

### Decentralization and Automation
A public API endpoint with crypto wallet integration promotes decentralization and automation by enabling autonomous agents to leverage the Render Network without relying on human intermediaries.

### Enhanced Efficiency
Automating the job creation and payment process streamlines workflows and improves efficiency for users who rely on automated systems for rendering tasks.

## Stakeholders Impacted
- **Developers**: Foundation and OTOY developers will need to create the API and wallet connections and test them thoroughly.
- **Creators/Artists**: Creators who rely on automated systems for rendering tasks will benefit from increased efficiency and reduced manual effort. Developers of agentic systems and blockchain applications will be able to integrate their creations with the Render Network more easily.
- **Node Operators**: The Render Network will experience increased usage and adoption as agentic systems become more prevalent.

## Implementation
The Render Network development team will be responsible for implementing the API endpoint and associated functionalities. This will involve:

**API Endpoint**  
   A new public API endpoint should be created specifically for programmatic job creation and payment. This endpoint should be accessible using standard API authentication methods (e.g., API keys).

**Crypto Wallet Integration**  
   The API should support integration with popular crypto wallets that hold RNDR tokens. This allows users to authorize payments for Render Network jobs directly from their wallets. Users should be able to log into the OTOY job site anonymously with only a wallet.

**Job Creation Parameters**  
   - **Scene Parameters**:  
     - Scene file(s)/parameters (text prompts for images/ai video)  
   - **Render Settings**:  
     - Quality settings  
     - Resolution  
     - Samples per pixel  
   - **Output Options**:  
     - Output format  
   - **Job Management**:  
     - Priority level (e.g., Priority, Economy)  
     - Frame range (single frame, range, or mix of ranges)  
     - Job name and animation settings  
     - Factors considered during job allocation include the creator's reputation score, scene size, and available concurrent nodes.
   - **Network/Job Query**:
     - Download Frames (single, range, all, watermarked previews to verify)    
     - Job status (frames in progress, completed, current cost)  
     - Queryable job cost estimate based on variables on site 
     - Ability to query availability levels per tier which are currently visible on the OTOY site when selecting priority

**Payment with RNDR**  
   The API should allow users to specify the amount of render/rndr to be used for payment. The system should provide multiple options, either topping up their balance on the OTOY site or paying in full before downloading the jobs.

**Credit Redemption**  
   To ensure a seamless experience, Render Credits should be redeemable for Render Time on the network at a 1:1 ratio to Render tokens.

**Error Handling and Status Updates**  
   The API should provide comprehensive error handling and status updates to inform users about the progress of their jobs and any potential issues encountered.

**Security Considerations**  
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect against denial-of-service attacks.  
   - Input validation to sanitize user input and prevent injection attacks.  
   - Secure authentication using API keys or tokens.  
   - Protection against denial-of-service attacks by restricting access to a limited number of messages per second according to server capacity.  
   - Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt data during transmission.

**Service Levels and Pricing**  
   The API can offer different service levels with varying resource allocations and pricing to cater to different user needs and budgets. These service levels may include options for web services, private services, and background workers.

## Technical Considerations
- **API Design**: The API should be designed with RESTful principles in mind, using standard HTTP methods and status codes.  
- **Wallet Integration**: Secure integration with popular crypto wallets is crucial. Factors to consider include security, ease of use, and popularity within the Render Network community.  
- **Security**: Robust security measures are essential to protect the API endpoint and user data. This includes rate limiting, input validation, secure authentication, and protection against denial-of-service attacks.  
- **Scalability**: The API should be designed to handle a large volume of requests as adoption increases.

## Potential Drawbacks
- **Development Cost**: Implementing the API endpoint will require development resources and time.  
- **Security Risks**: Any public API endpoint introduces potential security risks. Careful design and implementation are crucial to mitigate these risks.

## Conclusion
This RNP proposes a crucial step towards enabling seamless integration of agentic systems with the Render Network. By providing a public API endpoint with crypto wallet integration and a 1:1 credit/token redemption rate, the proposal empowers users to automate rendering tasks and leverage the network's capabilities in a decentralized and efficient manner.

This will not only streamline workflows for users who rely on automated systems but also further solidify the Render Network's position as a leading platform for decentralized rendering, fostering a more dynamic and accessible ecosystem for developers and creators. This, in turn, contributes to the long-term vision of creating a more accessible and efficient rendering ecosystem for everyone.
